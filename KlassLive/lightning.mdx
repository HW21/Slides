## Live <br/> Coding
### Or, Live <br/> Copy-Paste

</Split>

<Notes>
  The live coding does has a substantial effect though. 
  The act of watching the ideas emerge out of the speakers mind,
  conveys them in a way canned slides just cant.

## Problem 2: <br/> Keeping Up

```python
def step1(monkey):
    """ Let's write a function 
    that turns a monkey into a wrench. """
    return ...
```

---
## Keeping Up

```python
def step2(monkey):
    """ Now write a function that uses step1 
    to turn a monkey into a whole garage. """
    wrench = stage1(monkey)
    return ...
```

---
# Keeping Up

```python
def step73(monkey):
    """ Write a function that uses steps 1-72,
    to recreate the origins of the universe. """
    after_big_bang = stage72(monkey)
    return ...
```

Once any of stages 1-72 go wrong, <br/> 
you're done.
