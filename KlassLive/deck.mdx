# Some Problems
* Setup & Installation
* Keeping Up
* Fun! 

---
# Setup & Installation Fun 
C++ libs, crazy setup etc. 

---
# Keeping Up

```python
def stage1(monkey):
    """ Write a function that turns a monkey into a wrench. """
    return ...
```

---
<FullScreenCode>

```python
def stage2(monkey):
    """ Write a function that 
    uses stage 1 
    to turn a monkey 
    into a whole garage. """
    wrench = stage1(monkey)
    return ...
```

</FullScreenCode>

---
# Keeping Up

```python
def stage73(monkey):
    """ Write a function that uses stages 1-72,
    to recreate the origins of the universe. """
    wrench = stage1(monkey)
    return ...
```

Once any of stages 1-72 go wrong,
you're done.
